## How Can Legal Prep Help You?

Did you know there is a lot of crossover in the work accounting and legal professionals perform for businesses?  Much of the work is repetitive and ultimately can cost you more in time and fees.

**Easy Access to Common Needs:** From managing your capitalization tables to providing legal documents tailored to your needs, our certified legal professionals will have you fully prepared to meet with an attorney who will review and finalize everything.

**Reduce Your Costs:** A large portion of a startup's legal costs come from learning about your business and crafting legal documents from templates.  Since we already understand your business and most businesses have similar needs, we are in a great position to perform the early legal legwork for reduced time and fees.
