But once you begin to dive deeper, you see that it's about so much more than that.\n\nIt's what allows you to maintain a proper cash flow — something that has long been a major pain point for any organization. It's what allows you to make more accurate and informed decisions regarding growth. More than anything, it's what allows you to start making a plan for the future, which in and of itself is the most important benefit of all.\n\nHandling bookkeeping on your own can quickly become a full-time job, which is a bit of an issue since you already have one of those on your plate. But by keeping a few key things in mind, you can enjoy all the benefits of this process with as few of the potential downsides as possible.\n\n**The Art of Business Bookkeeping: Breaking Things Down**\n\nWhen it comes to small business bookkeeping, it's critical to understand what you should be doing and, most importantly, when. The financial health of your organization has both short- and long-term ramifications, and the only way to control your own trajectory is to make a list of what you should be doing and why.\n\nOn a weekly basis, for example, you'll want to pay close attention to things like your cash flow statement and variable expenses. Cash flow is exactly what it sounds like — the money coming into and out of your business. If you're not paying attention to this, you might not realize that you don't have nearly as much money coming in as you think. This is especially true if you're waiting on client invoices to get paid but have no real idea of when they were sent or when they're due.\n\nYou cannot assume that just because your revenue says one thing, you have an equal cash reserve sitting there waiting to be taken advantage of. Especially in the situation with client invoices outlined previously, that isn't always the case. If there is a sudden business opportunity that you're trying to take advantage of or if you need to pay for an urgent expense like a new piece of equipment or machinery, this is not the time to find out that your accounts don't have as much in them as you assumed they did.\n\nTherefore, you need to have a constant idea of how much cash you have on hand, along with the amount of money required to manage critical aspects of your business.\n\nVariable expenses are a related concept, which themselves are defined as those expenses that don't have a fixed monthly or annual rate. If you took out a loan to start your business, it's likely that you have a set, predictable monthly payment. Unless you miss a payment and get hit with some type of penalty, that number isn't going to change.\n\nMarketing, however, is something that changes all the time — particularly if you're experimenting with all the different types of campaigns that you could run. If you've invested in digital advertising on sites like Google, you're probably not going to hit upon the perfect campaign right away. You'll need to run tests to see what works and what doesn't, which will ultimately impact the amount of money you'll pay. If you move into the world of print advertising and run newspaper ads or design fliers, this too will come with an entirely different set of costs.\n\nAs a result of this, you need to make sure you understand what your variable expenses are at any given time. Only then will you be able to make the smartest and most informed decisions at the moment.\n\n**Additional Considerations About Bookkeeping**\n\nLikewise, there are a variety of important bookkeeping-related tasks that you'll want to perform on at least a monthly basis, too.\n\nOne of these involves getting a business snapshot — something that gives you a clear, concise idea of where you currently stand and the impacts of the decisions you've made over the past 30 days. A business snapshot will not only give you insight into things like your cash flow, but you'll also get to see sales, expenses, income, and more.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that these snapshots actually become more valuable as time goes on. You can compare the last several monthly snapshots to uncover trends and patterns that you may have otherwise missed. This, too, gives you insight into what you can do to improve your operations.\n\nOn a monthly basis, you should also make an effort to stay up-to-date on what all your expenses actually are. Yes, there are certain “costs of doing business” that you'll never be able to totally eliminate. But if you take the time at least regularly to look at where your money is going, you put yourself in a better position to find room for improvement.\n\nCase in point: Maybe that investment you made a few months ago isn't paying off nearly as well as you'd hoped. Unless you look at and understand exactly what you're spending, you're not necessarily going to realize that. Armed with this information, you can eliminate these types of expenses and free up valuable cash so that you can funnel it back into other areas of the business where it can do the most good.\n\nFinally, when it comes to a topic as important as bookkeeping, it's important to acknowledge your own limitations. Especially as far as things like taxes are concerned, the stakes of “getting this one wrong” are simply far too high to go at it yourself.\n\nYou're a business owner, and while it's absolutely fair to say that your “can-do spirit” has already gotten you quite far, if you're not comfortable handling bookkeeping yourself, you shouldn't feel obligated to do so. Enlisting the help of a trained, experienced professional can immediately help you paint a clear picture of where your business currently stands from a financial perspective and where it might be headed, too. They'll use bookkeeping software that, when combined with their own insight, can help make it far easier to accomplish all the tasks outlined above and more.\n\nA financial professional can step in and make sure that you have a solid foundation from which to build from, all while freeing up as much of your time as possible to focus on those tasks that actually require your full attention.\n\nIf you'd like to find out more information about all the best practices that you can use to get the most out of your business, or if you just have any additional questions you'd like to go over with someone in a bit more detail, please don't delay — contact our office today.\n\nTags [Growing Your Business](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/growing-your-business/)\n\n[PreviousPrevious post:The Obscure Research Credit](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/business20210928/)\n\n[NextNext post:Tips to Get Your Startup Off the Ground](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tax1/)",
