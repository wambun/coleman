This is why you need to do everything possible to sort out how you will take care of your startup's accounting functions. Using an outsourced accounting service offers many benefits. That is what we will explore with you today.\n\n## What Does an Outsourced Provider Do?\n\nAn outsourced accounting services provider offers startups the opportunity to take care of all of their various accounting needs without having to fully staff an in-house accounting team to do so. These providers can help you complete all of the accounting needs that you have without having the resources necessary to do so in-house.\n\n## Upsides of Using an Outsourced Provider\n\nBefore deciding on which type of accounting team you will use, consider the pros and cons of each option. Some of the upsides of an outsourced provider include the following:\n\n- **Cost-Effectiveness -**The price that one has to pay for their outsourced accounting services can be significantly less costly than what one might have to pay for an entire in-house team of accountants. That is one of the first considerations that all companies make when thinking about the accounting team that they need.\n\n- **Reduced Levels of Fraud -** There is always a risk of fraud in any organization, and that risk is particularly high in the accounting department. Having access to all of the financials contained within a business can make it very tempting for someone to take advantage of the situation. Even one instance of fraud can be extremely damaging to a company. With an outsourced provider, the instances of fraud are significantly reduced.\n\n- **Scalability -** Your business isn't going to remain the same size forever! You need to have the flexibility to grow your accounting team as your company grows. Doing so via an in-house team can be costly and burdensome. However, scaling up with an outsourced provider is quite easy. Simply request more resources be put towards your projects, and your outsourced provider can offer that to you immediately.\n\n- **Trusted Partnerships -** It is possible to build deep and trusted relationships with the company that you have hired for your outsourced accounting needs as they integrate into your company much like fulltime employees.\n\n- **Complete Control -** You will have complete control over all of your accounting projects when you have an outsourced accounting team working on these tasks. You can always see what is going on within your finances and make tweaks and changes as necessary.\n\nThese are a few of the reasons why many companies opt to go with an outsourced provider instead of an in-house team. We live in a dynamic and constantly changing world. You need to keep your startup as agile and flexible to the changing nature of business as you possibly can. This means using outsourced providers that can adjust to meet your needs whenever possible.\n\nAt JColeman Consulting, we are ready to fulfill all your accounting needs when you are!\n\nTags [business](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/business/) [Business Life](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/business-life/) [cash flow](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/cash-flow/) [Growing Your Business](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/growing-your-business/) [Tax](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/tax/) [Tax Credit](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/tax-credit/)\n\n[PreviousPrevious post:Signs You Should Stop Managing Your Own Books](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/signs-you-should-stop-managing-your-own-books/)\n\n[NextNext post:Don’t Make These Accounting Mistakes in Your Startup!](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/dont-make-these-accounting-mistakes-in-your-startup/)",
