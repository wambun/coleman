Cleantech Stealth Startup

Co-Founder

"I was referred to JColeman Consulting when I was looking for some additional finance and accounting leadership and support for the team during my paternity leave. The JColeman team proved to be invaluable from the start, providing strategic support and planning up front, and then ensuring that everything ran smoothly once I was out. We've retained them past my return, to help us define the strategy for our accounting and finance functions, and will continue to lean on them going forward. They are highly responsive, flexible and willing to help wherever and however is needed. They work seamlessly with both internal stakeholders and external parties, representing Gordian with the highest level of professionalism. We couldn't imagine navigating our financial journey and growth without them!"

Bharath Kumandan

VP, Operations

"JColeman, specifically Brad, has been a breath of fresh air for our team. As a startup, we immensely rely on outside accounting teams. JColeman associates have been responsive, professional, and experts in their field since the start. They are always easily accessible and quick to respond for any inquiries we may have. Their professionalism is evident in the gatekeeping they have set up during the onboarding process to ensure they have a complete picture of our needs. Due to their expertise, they were able to find a $8000 refund we were due that had gone unnoticed for years!"

JColeman Consulting has been a trusted resource for my firm for nearly a year. I interviewed 5 firms in this space and went with JColeman because they were fast and got the job done right. I've now worked with six members of their team and an unexpected benefit has been how they can provide additional resources on a tight timeline. Highly recommend you give them a shot!
