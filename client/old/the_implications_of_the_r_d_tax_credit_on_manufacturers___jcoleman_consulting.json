Rather than being allowed to deduct those costs immediately, companies are now being told that they must spread those costs out over a period of five years.\n\nUnsurprisingly, those companies are none too thrilled with that change. It has the potential to hurt manufacturers in a number of different ways, all of which are worth exploring.\n\n#### **The R&D Tax Policy Change: An Overview**\n\n[In a letter that was sent](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-cfos-ask-congress-to-repeal-change-to-r-d-tax-rules-11667845533) on November 4, 2022, no less than 178 CFOs - primarily those from some of the biggest names in United States manufacturing like Ford Motor Company, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and others - outlined why they believe that these aforementioned new rules would lead to what they call a \"competitive disadvantage\" for American companies. This in turn would almost certainly lead to job losses, which would in turn harm their ability to innovate over the next decade.\n\nTheir point of view was simple: they were asking the current Congress to switch back to a system that allowed them to immediately deduct their costs when it came to research and development as soon as the end of the year.\n\nIt's important to note that in a general sense, research and development investment does not spread evenly across the economy. It tends to be heavily localized in a few key spaces, with manufacturing being chief among them. In fact, the manufacturing sector alone accounts for 58% of all research and development costs [according to one recent study](https://taxfoundation.org/rd-expensing-rd-amortization/).\n\nTo contextualize that in a different way, it means that the manufacturing sector would face a significant tax increase as per the research cited above - to the tune of $31.7 billion in 2023 alone which is directly attributed to this new approach to R&D amortization.\n\nIt's equally important to note that, until January 1, 2022, businesses could deduct 100% of all expenses that were directly attributed to research and development in the same year that they were incurred. With January 1, 2023, on the other hand, this new law goes into effect. This essentially makes it not only more expensive to invest in advancements that will help innovate various sectors like manufacturing, but in the growth of these companies as well.\n\nMany agree that this means that the sector won't just get hit, it will get hit significantly. This is essentially a major new expense - the fact that the tax liabilities of these companies are about to increase exponentially - that was not anticipated up to this moment.\n\nOne company that is particularly worried about the implications of this change is Miltec UV. Right now, company leadership believes that an exciting new opportunity is within reach. They have spent years developing a new technology for lithium-ion batteries - otherwise known as the rechargeable batteries that are found in countless devices like your smartphone or tablet. This new technology could potentially be used for next-generation electric vehicles.\n\nMiltec UV has [poured no less than 11 years](https://www.nam.org/were-gonna-get-hit-hard-how-an-rd-tax-policy-change-hurts-manufacturers-19819/?stream=policy-legal) of development into manufacturing the electrodes that will be used in these batteries. They've spent countless amounts of money on prototyping. There has been various proof of concepts developed to indicate that these microbes can do what the company thinks they can. There has been testing. On top of it all, there is the cost to manufacture the batteries. Officials agree that they are very close to the point where they can commercialize the batteries and begin to sell them, but with these new rule changes that also means that they will have to pay more taxes than they previously thought they would.\n\nIn the event that these tax changes are not reversed, industry leaders fear that they will hurt profits in the short-term. This could then negatively impact essential benefits that employees at manufacturing companies have come to count on.\n\nFor the record, Miltec UV is also an organization that funds all of its research and development efforts through the profits of its various commercial businesses. It has eschewed taking on outside investment in the past and hopes to continue to do so moving forward.\n\nRegardless of whether Congress reverses these changes, one thing is for certain - this is a development that the entirety of the manufacturing industry will be paying close attention to moving forward.\n\nTags [business](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/business/) [Tax Credit](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/tag/tax-credit/)\n\n[PreviousPrevious post:Converting an S Corp to a C Corp](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/converting-an-s-corp-to-a-c-corp/)\n\n[NextNext post:Reasonable Compensation in Wages an S Corp Stockholder](https://jcolemanconsulting.com/reasonable-compensation-in-wages-an-s-corp-stockholder/)",
